# Code-Compendium-for-SIA-2026
This repository is where, each week, I will add new methods and functions that have been created for image analysis tasks, such as filtering, thresholding, Fourier Transforms to name a few. 

The functions included so far are:

1) first_step(file_path)
        - Given a path to an image, this function will output the image, the image size             and type, and pixel value type, as well as the minimum and maximum.
2)
